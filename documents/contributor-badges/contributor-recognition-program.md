## üéñÔ∏è Badge Usage

Badges are not just symbolic inside the OJP community.  
When you are awarded a badge, it‚Äôs yours to use freely in **CVs, LinkedIn profiles, personal websites, presentations, or any other documents** to showcase your contribution and recognition in the open-source ecosystem.

Each badge reflects **real impact** in code, testing, documentation, or community growth ‚Äî something to be proud of and share widely.

- Actively mentors or inspires contributors.  
- Broadly recognized by the community as a leader.  

---

## üéñÔ∏è How Badges Are Awarded

- **Community-driven nominations**:  
  Anyone who already holds an OJP badge can nominate another contributor for recognition.

- **Review and discretion**:  
  Nominations are reviewed by the **project founder** and **OJP Champions**, who have the discretion to accept or decline based on impact, consistency, and community feedback.

- **Direct awards**:  
  The founder and Champions can also **directly nominate and award badges** to contributors without a prior nomination if their contributions clearly merit recognition.

- **Recognition, not bureaucracy**:  
  The process is designed to be **lightweight, fair, and community-first** ‚Äî focused on celebrating real contributions rather than ticking boxes.

- **High-impact figures**:  
  Recognized leaders in the Java or broader tech community (e.g., Java Champions, conference speakers, authors of influential projects) may be awarded higher badges ‚Äî including **direct entry to OJP Champion** ‚Äî due to the exceptional reach and visibility of their contributions.


üí° **Note**: Contributions across **multiple tracks** (e.g., code + docs + community) can **accelerate the path to the OJP Champion badge**, reflecting well-rounded impact.
