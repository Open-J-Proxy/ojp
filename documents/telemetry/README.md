# Telemetry Documentation

OJP (Open JDBC Proxy) provides comprehensive observability features to monitor and trace database operations through its telemetry system.

## Supported Telemetry Features

### Distributed Tracing with OpenTelemetry
OJP implements distributed tracing using the OpenTelemetry standard, allowing you to:
- Track SQL operations across the proxy and database layers
- Monitor connection lifecycle and performance
- Trace requests from client applications through the proxy to the database
- Correlate database operations with application traces

### Metrics via Prometheus Exporter
OJP exposes operational metrics through a Prometheus-compatible endpoint, providing insights into:
- Connection pool utilization and health
- Query execution times and throughput
- Error rates and connection failures
- gRPC communication metrics
- Database-specific performance indicators

## Accessing Telemetry Data

### Prometheus Metrics
Metrics are exposed via HTTP endpoint and can be scraped by Prometheus:
- **Default endpoint**: `http://localhost:9090/metrics`
- **Format**: Prometheus text-based exposition format
- **Update frequency**: Real-time metrics updated on each operation

To access metrics:
1. Configure Prometheus to scrape the OJP server metrics endpoint
2. Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize the metrics
3. Create alerts based on connection pool health and performance thresholds

### OpenTelemetry Traces
Traces can be exported to various backends supported by OpenTelemetry:
- **Jaeger**: For distributed tracing visualization
- **Zipkin**: Alternative tracing backend
- **OTLP receivers**: Any OpenTelemetry Protocol compatible system
- **Cloud providers**: AWS X-Ray, Google Cloud Trace, Azure Monitor

## Configuration Options

The telemetry system can be configured through the OJP server configuration file. Below is a placeholder YAML configuration example:

```

```

## Integration Examples

### With Prometheus and Grafana
1. Configure Prometheus to scrape OJP metrics
2. Import OJP Grafana dashboard templates
3. Set up alerts for connection pool exhaustion and high error rates


## Best Practices

- **Production Sampling**: Reduce trace sampling rate in production to minimize overhead
- **Metric Retention**: Configure appropriate retention policies for metrics storage
- **Security**: Ensure telemetry endpoints are properly secured in production environments
- **Performance**: Monitor the performance impact of telemetry collection on the proxy
